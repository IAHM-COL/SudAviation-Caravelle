Introduction

In 1951 the French SGACC (Commercial aircraft authority) publishes a specification for a medium range aircraft carrying 55 to 65 passengers and a ton of cargo. The range should be 2000 km and cruise speed 600 km/h. The type and number of engines isn’t specified. There was a big response from the French industry since 20 projects were presented. It was Sud Aviation with their X210 model which was chosen. The 3 Atar 101 engines which were initially foreseen were soon replaced with two Rolls Royce Avon engines.

In 1953 the SGACC ordered two prototypes and two test-beds, the planes was now called SE 210 Caravelle.

The first prototype flew on 27-May-55, the second followed on 06-May-56. The first prototype had a cargo door on the lower left side of the fuselage. This feature reappeared only later with the 11R model. The nose of the two prototypes was a modified De Havilland Comet nose.

The first order was from Air France in ‘56 followed by SAS in ‘57. More orders followed, mainly triggered by presentations on airshows and demonstrations to potential customers. The Caravelle was certified in May-59 and entered shortly after service with SAS and AF.
The Caravelle I and IA

19 + 13 models were built. They were 50cm longer than the prototype, had higher weights and bigger engines.
The Caravelle III

78 models were built. They had the same length than the Series I but had again higher weights and bigger engines. The Series III was the best-selling Caravelle. Out of the 32 Series I, 31 were upgraded to Series III specs.
The Caravelle VI N
53 models were built. They had the same length than the Series I but had bigger engines. This series was launched in 1960. Out of the 78 Series III, 5 were upgraded to Series VI N specs.
The Caravelle VI R

56 models were built, 20 were for United Airlines. This series was launched in 1961. The differences of N and R series were thrust reversers, upgraded cockpit and airbrakes.
The Caravelle VII

This was a modified Series III which was purchased by General Electric. This series VII was equipped with GE engines and made it’s first flight in 1960.
The Caravelle 10A

Only one series 10A was built. This was based on the series VII but was stretched by 1 meter. The windows were located 20 cm higher in the fuselage. An APU was installed. A modified wing with improved flaps was also included. As all American airlines chose purely American products, no Caravelle 10A was ordered.
The Caravelle 10B

Based on the dead-born 10A this series was equipped with PW engines. All modifications of the 10A were included in the 10B design. The new Pratt & Whitney engines gave a new push to the Caravelle, the series 10B first flew in 1964 and a total of 22 were built.
The Caravelle 10R

20 series 10R were built. First flight was in 1965. This series consisted of putting the PW engines on the VIR frame, which made it smaller and cheaper than the series 10B.
The Caravelle 11R

This series was based on the 10R and had the cargo hold of the prototype. This enabled this series to carry a mixed load of passengers and cargo. First flight of the series 11R was in 1967 a total of 6 planes was built. This was the last development of the basic frame.
The Caravelle 12

This series was obtained by stretching the 10B by 3.2 meters. The main target were the charterflights. The series 12 had a capacity of 128 passengers and a reduced range. First flight of the series 12 was in 1970 (?) a total of 12 planes was built.

Sud Aviation Caravelle technical data

The data of the present table was collected by using different sources. However errors are human, if you think that one figure is not correct, or if you know the value of one of the missing parameters, feel free to post me an . Don't forget to tell me your source.

Since documentation on the Caravelle isn't very easy to find I would be happy for any additional technical information.

Sud Aviation Caravelle pictures

Sud Caravelle 	I had the chance to make this picture 1996 in LUX. The plane was operated by Air Provence. I consider this bird as a 'flying museum'.This plane is now parked and had completed at the end of '95, 48961 hours and 30640 cycles. In 1997 there were worldwide 20 Caravelles in service, with 11 in Colombia. [image size 31k]
